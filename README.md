# C - Binary trees


## Applications of Binary Trees
Binary trees are used in many areas of computer science and other fields, including:

Algorithms: Binary trees are used in algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
Databases: Binary trees are used in database systems for indexing and organizing data.
File systems: Binary trees are used in file systems to organize and store data on disk.
Artificial intelligence: Binary trees are used in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms for decision making and data analysis.
Programming languages: Binary trees are used in programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python as a data structure for organizing and manipulating data.


In summary, binary trees are a powerful and versatile data structure that are used in many areas of computer science and other fields to organize and analyze data.

## Usage

In order to run this function, you neet to :

Clone this repositery : gh repo clone francois0002/holbertonschool-binary_trees

Compile the shell using the following command:
You need to add in the directory "holbertonschool-binary_trees" your own main.c.
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
You can run the program with this command ./binary_trees in that same directory.
